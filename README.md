This application allows you to integrate OpsGenie with your Mattermost instance to notify you of new and updated alerts, as well as allow you to create, manage, and assign new alerts without leaving Mattermost.

# Feature summary

**OpsGenie to Mattermost notifications:** Link Mattermost channels with OpsGenie Teams to receive notifications about new and updated alerts.

# Set up

To install, as a Mattermost system admin user, run the command `/apps install http OPSGENIE_API` in any channel. The `/genie` command should be available after the configuration has been successfully installed.

The `OPSGENIE_API` should be replaced with the URL where the OpsGenie API instance is running. Example: `/apps install http https://myapp.com/manifest.json`

## Install on Mattermost Cloud

To install, as a Mattermost system admin user, run the command `/apps install listed genie` in any channel. The `/genie` command should be available after the configuration has been successfully installed.

# Development environment

## Manual installation

- Download the latest repository release.

### Run the local development environment

- You need to have at least Node version 15 and maximum version 18 installed. You can download the latest LTS version of Node for your operating system here: https://nodejs.org/es/download/

### Install dependencies

- Move to the project directory or execute `cd` command to the project directory and execute `npm install` with a terminal to download all dependency libraries.

```
$ npm install
```

- Update the environment configuration file. The `.env` file must be modified or added to set the environment variables, it must be in the root of the repository.

```
file: .env

PROJECT=mattermost-opsgenie-app
PORT=4002
HOST=http://localhost:4002
```

Variable definition

- PROJECT: When executing the project with Docker using the `.build.sh` file, this variable will be used for the name of the container.
- PORT: The port number the OpsGenie integration is listening to.
- HOST: The OpsGenie API usage URL.

* Finally, the project must be executed by running the following command:

```
$ npm run dev
```

Or, you can use the Makefile command:

```
$ make watch
```

### Run the local development environment with Docker

- You need to have Docker installed. You can find the necessary steps to install Docker for the following operating systems:

[Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
[Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)
[Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

- Once you have Docker installed, run the `make run-server` command to create the API container and expose it locally or on the server, depending on the case required.

```
$ make run-server
```

When the container is created correctly, the API runs at `http://127.0.0.1:4002`. If Mattermost is running on the same machine, run the following slash command in Mattermost to install the app:

```
/apps install http http://127.0.0.1:4002
```

To stop the container, run the following command:

```
$ make stop-server
```
